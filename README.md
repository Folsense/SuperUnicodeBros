Mario in the command line

Please don't try to learn from this I don't know how to write code properly.
To use it, run make and then ./mario.

# This has only been tested on Linux
But I think the only non-standard library used is for keyboard inputs, so if you want to make it work you should be able to just change the Controller class to use whatever library works on your system and then change the makefile flags.
